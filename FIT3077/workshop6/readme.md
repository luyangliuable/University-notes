## Part a

The adaptor does not need to wrap only one class each time. You could build a facade and then use an adaptor.

## Part b
If the interface requires a lot of code to be changed or it changes constantly then it should be better to use an adaptor saving a lot of time.

## Part c
The facade contains methods that utilise the methods from lower level functionalities to create new or combine functionalities. The client can gain access to the lower level functions through calling the facade methods if it has them.

## Part d
Facade can add new functionalities.
