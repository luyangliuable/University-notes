## Operating Systems

* Algorithms and techniques used to implement operating systems are useful to computer scientist in general.

## Learning Outcomes
* Evaluate various **strategies** used by OS in managing the system resources and running applications efficiently.
* Analyse and identify parameters that can improve the performance of **multi-programming** operating systems.
* Apply **Synchronisation techniques** in the development of application using operating systems. 

## Assessments
* Exam has multiple choice (more than 1 answer) rewards understand rather than memorisation.
* Mid semester test held in week 7.
* Two C programming assignments (Part A and B) 30% of total mark
* Practical and tutorial assessment 10% of unit mark.

   
## Linux Virtual Machine
* **Do not have to use virtual machine**
* **Assignment and lab tasks are expected to run in this environment**

C programming is hazardous direct access to memory means that a bad section of code that runs on one machine may crash on another

* Lab tasks in this unit will produce different results on different machines.

## TODO List
  * [ ] Prepare Tutes before class and after material is released 
  * [ ] Download VirtualBox and try to install the virtual machine
  * [ ] Get familiar with the reading matierlas on the unit info page you might need them later in semester.
