* Promotes alignment collaboration and delivery across large numbers of agile teams.
 
* Formed around three primary bodies of knowledge, **agile**, **software development**, **lean product development**, and **systems thinking**

## Configurations of SAFe

* There are four configurations of SAFe
  * Essential SAFe
  * Large Solution SAFe
  * Portfolio SAFe
  * Full SAFe

## Before SAFe vs after SAFe was introduced
* SAFe was introduced by **Drew Jemilo and Dean Leffingwell** in 2011
* Before SAFe was introduced, teams used **traditional project management process to delivery software**.
* SAFe's introduction was required to rapidly respond to changing market conditions increased, new frameworks emerged to help businesses improve solution delivery across their enterprise, and SAFe was born.

## Core principles and values of SAFe

* Describe the culture that leadership needs to foster
* How people should behave within that culture in order to effectively use that framework

## Alignment

* There is no bureaucracy, information flows both upward and downward in a timely fashion, unlike traditional top-down command and control structures.
* However, this often requires companies to put aside their tradition structure aside and put planning and *refection cadences* in place at all levels of the organisation.
* By synchronising people and activities regularly, all levels of the portfolio stay in alignment

## Built-in quality
* On-time delivery should never come at the cost of quality. This often require teams at all levels to define the definition of done and to bake quality development practices  into every working agreement.
* According to SAFe there are 5 key dimensions of built-in quality:
    * flow
    * architecture and design quality
    * code quality
    * system quality
    * release quality

## Transparency
SAFe encourages **trust-building behaviour**, including planning work in smaller batch sizes so problems can be surfaced sooner, providing real-time visibility into backlog progress across levels, and **inspect and adapt rituals**

## Program Execution
Teams and programs must be able to deliver **quality**, **working software** and **business value** on a regular basis.

## Leadership
SAFe requires lean-agile leadership behavior because only leaders can change the system and create the environment necessary to embrace all of the core values.

In SAFe anyone can voice their opinion and it could change the system in inspect and adapt processes and retrospectives.

## SAFe Principles
* Aim: improve the company as a whole.
* Inspire lean-agile deciding making
  * Cross-functional teams
  * Organisational boundaries? TODO
* Applies to everyone in the organisation

## Principle 1: Take an economic view
* Sequencing jobs for maximum benefit understanding and economic tradeoff, and operating within lean budget are als responsibilities that need to be shared throughout the organisation.m
* Achieve the result in the shortest, sustainable lead-time quires everyone in the team in the decision making chain to understand the economic impact and delays. 
* For example, the product manager knows how each feature is important in the market and developments knows if a user stories would take too much time or cost to implement.

## Principle 2: Apply systems thinking
