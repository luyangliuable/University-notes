## Things risk can affect 

* Useless to customer
* Some are project specific

## What kind of risks are there
* Some kinds of risk can affect **any project**
    * Loss of members
    * Customer pulling out
    * Nature disaster (Rare)
    * Cold outbreak in winter (Common)
    
* Some are **project-specific**
    * Third-part library unusable or insecure requirements not properly communicated or understood.
     Some kinds of software inherently hard to test.

## Risk Mitigation
* Avoidance: Don't do the risk at all or make the risk impossible from occurring
* reduction: minimise the likelihood or impact or risk
* Transfer: make it somebody else's problem (e.g. insurance)
* acceptance: decide to wear the cost if the worst happens

It is most important to come up with good **risk mitigation strategies** is much more important

## Technical risks
* A spike is one way to deal with risks posed in technical environment
* Usually a result of lack of knowledge
* So experimenting is a good way to obtain knowledge 
* Questions
    * "how do I?"
    * "How long does it take to?"
    * "is it easy to?"
* Came from Xtreme programming

TODO missing

## Documenting Spikes TODO
* So team mate can access information gained from spike
* In the future, can access the information gained from spike

## Risk Monitoring
* To make sure someone keeps an eye on the risk to ensure the risk mitigation strategies is in action.

## Quantifying risk TODO
* Want to measure risk

## Impact of a risk:
* How badly the risk may affect the project
    * Small impact (e.g. spelling mistake)
    * Major impact (e.g. translation for a new language)

* May be measure in "points" or on a scale
    * 1, 2, 3
    * Low, medium high
