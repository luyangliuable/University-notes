TODO


## User stories
Are short simple descriptions for designs and capabilities, usually in the perspective of a user or customer of the system.

```

  * A longer term context for near term decisions in a way that is both practical and inspirational.

* Solution vision TODO
  * Translating the portfolio vision or solution vision such as architecture and the reason and direction behind the chosen solution.

* Important!
* Cadence based, face-to-face event that series as the heartbeat of the agile release train (ART), aligning all the teams on the ART of to a shared mission and vision.

* Similar to **Spring planning in Scrum**
