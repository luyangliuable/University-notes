## What is mentorship

Mentorship is a guiding process whereby an experienced individual guides another by **giving descriptions of their experience** and lead the individual to grow.

## What is the limitation of mentorship?

The mentor cannot do everything for the individual, it is up to the individual to grow and mentor only provides a possible solution

## Mentor mentees relationship

* Two sides long-term relationship
* Set expectations and goals together at the very onset
* Don't assume anything and ask
* Learning and connection beyond grades

## Recommended roles

* A diverse team leads to a happy team
* [Plug-Compatible Programming Units](/Users/rubber/University-notes/FIT2101/agile-uncommon-things-to-know/)

|               | RTE         | PM      | SA           |
|---------------|:-----------:|:-------:|:------------:|
| Openness      | low         | High 1  | Neutral      |
| Conscientious | High        | Neutral | Neutral/High |
| Extroversion  | Neutral     | High    | Low          |
| Agreeableness | High        | Neutral | Low          |
| Neuroticism   | Neutral/low | low     | neutral      |
  
### Openness TODO  

### Conscientious: 
Diligence

### Extroversion
Higher is better for dealing with clients

### Agreeableness
Lower is better for SA because you need to be assertive with your knowledge

### Neuroticism
* Judgemental
* Shy
* Not confident
* Lower means more confidence and less self-judgement

As RTE is okay to have neutral

## Positive vs negative feedback
* Constructive and professional

### Characteristics of Good feedback
* Objective and clear
* Recommend some solutions (areas of improvement)

## Work breakdown log
* Name, Date, assigned task, status, summery of work done
* Don't miss writing a relevant and clear summary

## Splitting group
**You must have pipeline** 

1. By epics or features (functional decomposition)
2. By architecture:
    a. front-end
    b. back-end
    c. DevOps (security pipeline and etc) TODO but hard to split this architecture evenly compared to the other ones

### Splitting group options
* Recommendation only 1 product manager, otherwise 2 agile teams without different visions
1 PM - Product owner
1 RTE - Scrum masters
2 SAs - Agile Teams

### Dos and Don't in teams
* **Do not work at a minimum standard** (bare minimum)
     * Not good for whole team
     * Raise the bar for the standard
     
## Limitation of mentor ship
However, a mentor cannot do everything if anything for the individual. It is up to the individual to grow.
